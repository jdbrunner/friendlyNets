# FriendlyNets

FriendlyNets provides a method for assessing the promotion/inhibition effect on a microbe of a microbial community using a network of community interactions. At its core, FriendlyNets judges how much a network
promotes or inhibits one of its nodes. It does this by assuming a set dynamical system represented by the network, and using the resulting dynamics. FriendlyNets is also packaged with functions for generating 
a network from a set of genome-scale metabolic by simulating pairwise growth using the methods from Kim et al., 2022[[1]](#1).

## Dependencies

We use `joblib` for parallel computing.

SteadyComX uses Gurobi for joint FBA, and takes COBRApy model objects as input.
